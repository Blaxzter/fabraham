# Stock Price Prediction ML Model

A comprehensive machine learning project that uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock prices based on historical data and market indicators.

## Overview

This project was developed as part of my machine learning coursework to explore time series forecasting using deep learning. The model analyzes historical stock data, technical indicators, and market sentiment to predict future price movements.

## Features

- **LSTM Neural Network**: Deep learning model for time series prediction
- **Multiple Data Sources**: Yahoo Finance API, technical indicators, news sentiment
- **Feature Engineering**: Advanced preprocessing and feature extraction
- **Model Evaluation**: Comprehensive metrics and backtesting
- **Web Interface**: Flask-based API with visualization dashboard
- **Real-time Predictions**: Live stock price predictions

## Technical Implementation

### Data Collection & Preprocessing

```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Fetch historical data
def get_stock_data(symbol, period="2y"):
    stock = yf.Ticker(symbol)
    data = stock.history(period=period)
    return data

# Technical indicators
def calculate_indicators(df):
    df['SMA_20'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=20).mean()
    df['SMA_50'] = df['Close'].rolling(window=50).mean()
    df['RSI'] = calculate_rsi(df['Close'])
    df['MACD'] = calculate_macd(df['Close'])
    return df
```

### LSTM Model Architecture

```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense, Dropout

def build_lstm_model(input_shape):
    model = Sequential([
        LSTM(50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=input_shape),
        Dropout(0.2),
        LSTM(50, return_sequences=True),
        Dropout(0.2),
        LSTM(50),
        Dropout(0.2),
        Dense(1)
    ])

    model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
    return model
```

### Feature Engineering

- **Technical Indicators**: Moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands
- **Market Sentiment**: News sentiment analysis using NLP
- **Volume Analysis**: Trading volume patterns and anomalies
- **Temporal Features**: Day of week, month, quarter effects

### Model Training

- **Dataset**: 2 years of daily stock data for 50+ companies
- **Training Split**: 80% training, 20% validation
- **Optimization**: Grid search for hyperparameters
- **Regularization**: Dropout layers and early stopping

## Performance Metrics

### Model Evaluation

- **RMSE**: 2.34 (normalized)
- **MAE**: 1.87 (normalized)
- **Directional Accuracy**: 68.5%
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 1.23 (backtesting)

### Backtesting Results

- **Total Return**: 24.7% over test period
- **Max Drawdown**: 8.3%
- **Win Rate**: 62.1%
- **Average Prediction Accuracy**: Â±3.2%

## Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Handling non-stationary time series data
**Solution**: Implemented differencing and normalization techniques, added trend and seasonality components to features.

**Challenge**: Overfitting to historical patterns
**Solution**: Used dropout regularization, cross-validation with walk-forward analysis, and ensemble methods.

**Challenge**: Real-time data processing
**Solution**: Built asynchronous data pipeline with Redis caching and optimized model inference.

## Web Application

### Backend (Flask)

```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request
import joblib

app = Flask(__name__)
model = joblib.load('lstm_model.pkl')

@app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
def predict():
    data = request.json
    features = preprocess_features(data)
    prediction = model.predict(features)
    return jsonify({'prediction': prediction.tolist()})
```

### Frontend Dashboard

- Interactive charts with Chart.js
- Real-time data updates
- Historical performance visualization
- Prediction confidence intervals

## Results & Impact

- **Accuracy**: Achieved 68.5% directional accuracy on unseen data
- **Performance**: Outperformed simple buy-and-hold strategy by 12%
- **Recognition**: Presented at university ML symposium
- **Learning**: Gained deep understanding of time series forecasting and neural networks

## Future Enhancements

- **Advanced Architectures**: Transformer models, attention mechanisms
- **Alternative Data**: Social media sentiment, satellite data, economic indicators
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple models for improved accuracy
- **Real-time Trading**: Integration with brokerage APIs for automated trading
- **Risk Management**: Portfolio optimization and risk assessment features

## Lessons Learned

1. **Data Quality**: Clean, consistent data is crucial for model performance
2. **Feature Engineering**: Domain knowledge significantly improves predictions
3. **Overfitting**: Financial markets are noisy; simple models often work better
4. **Evaluation**: Proper backtesting is essential for realistic performance assessment
