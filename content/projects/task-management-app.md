# Collaborative Task Management App

A comprehensive task management application that enables teams to collaborate in real-time, track progress, and manage deadlines effectively.

## Overview

This full-stack application was developed to solve the problem of team coordination in academic and professional projects. It features real-time updates, user authentication, and an intuitive interface for managing tasks across multiple projects.

## Features

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Live updates when team members make changes
- **User Authentication**: Secure login/registration with JWT tokens
- **Project Management**: Create and manage multiple projects with team members
- **Task Tracking**: Assign tasks, set deadlines, and track completion status
- **File Sharing**: Upload and share project-related documents
- **Notifications**: Email and in-app notifications for important updates

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (Node.js)

- **Express.js** for RESTful API development
- **Socket.io** for real-time communication
- **MongoDB** with Mongoose for data persistence
- **JWT** for authentication and authorization
- **Multer** for file upload handling

### Frontend (React)

- **React Hooks** for state management
- **React Router** for navigation
- **Socket.io Client** for real-time updates
- **Axios** for HTTP requests
- **Material-UI** for component library

### Database Design

```javascript
// User Schema
{
  name: String,
  email: String,
  password: String,
  avatar: String,
  projects: [ObjectId]
}

// Project Schema
{
  title: String,
  description: String,
  members: [ObjectId],
  tasks: [ObjectId],
  createdAt: Date
}

// Task Schema
{
  title: String,
  description: String,
  assignee: ObjectId,
  project: ObjectId,
  status: Enum,
  priority: Enum,
  dueDate: Date
}
```

## Key Implementations

### Real-time Updates

Implemented Socket.io rooms for project-specific updates, ensuring users only receive relevant notifications.

### Security

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT token validation middleware
- Input sanitization and validation
- CORS configuration for secure cross-origin requests

### Performance Optimization

- Database indexing for faster queries
- Image compression for avatars and file uploads
- Lazy loading for task lists
- Debounced search functionality

## Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Managing real-time state synchronization
**Solution**: Implemented a Redux-like state management pattern with Socket.io events to ensure data consistency across all connected clients.

**Challenge**: File upload and storage
**Solution**: Used Multer for handling multipart/form-data and implemented file type validation and size limits.

## Results

- Successfully deployed and used by 50+ students
- 99.5% uptime over 6 months
- Average response time under 200ms
- Positive feedback from beta testers

## Future Improvements

- Mobile app development with React Native
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Integration with popular tools (Slack, Trello)
- AI-powered task prioritization
